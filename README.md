Welcome to The Maze Project! This game is a culmination of my passion for problem-solving, game development, and applying theoretical concepts in a practical setting. The Maze Project challenges players to navigate through intricate mazes, developed using SDL2, and showcases advanced pathfinding algorithms and user interaction techniques.
